# Makemore Exercise

This repo is to rebuild [Karpathy's makemore repo](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) as an exercise in creation of a character-level LM to auto-generate unique names, given a source of pre-existing ones.

Emphasis is on an examination of the machine learning principles around how this tool will work rather than just writing code to make it work.
